## Freetime

I live in Denver with my family and 2 dogs.
I enjoy downhill skiing, technology advancements, and geeking out with FIRST and just for fun.

## Profession

I love software development - almost all of it - and the parts I don't I work to improve.

I currently work with Angular, Azure (.net App Services, C# Function Apps, Storage - Static Web Hosting, and B2C), Azure DevOps (CI/CD Pipelines), as well as supporting on-premise systems for a medium-sized media company.

I love developing peoples abilities to deliver code faster, cleaner, and having great time while doing it.

I enjoy building strong collaborative teams, hands-on-keyboard or off.

I strive for symmathesy - check it out -> [Symmathesy](https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/ "Symmathesy").
