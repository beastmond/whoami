## Me as a Person

I live in Denver with my family and 2 dogs.
I enjoy downhill skiing, technology advancements, and geeking out with FIRST and just for fun.

# Me at Work

I love developing peoples abilities to deliver code faster, cleaner, and having great time while doing it.
I enjoy building strong collaborative teams, hands-on-keyboard or off.

I strive for symmathesy - check it out -> (https://norabateson.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/symmathesy-a-word-in-progress/).
